# PlanXFlow
Welcome to PlanXFlow, a software development lifecycle designed for engineering AI planning systems. PlanXFlow is developed with the ambition to provide a structured, waterfall-like yet iterative approach tailored to the unique challenges in AI planning. This lifecycle encompasses ten carefully designed phases, guiding practitioners and researchers from the conceptualization of AI planning systems to their deployment and beyond.

PlanXFlow acts as a foundational guide, promoting a holistic understanding of AI planning system development. It is designed to foster a common language among practitioners, researchers, and stakeholders, guiding them through the intricacies of AI planning.

## The Ten Phases

1. **Requirements Analysis**
2. **Planning Model Formulation**
3. **Domain Model Design**
4. **System Design and Architecture**
5. **Planning Technology Selection**
6. **Implementation**
7. **Testing**
8. **Deployment**
9. **Monitoring**
10. **Analysis**

## Innovative Elements

PlanXFlow introduces and emphasizes crucial concepts often sidelined in the academic literature on AI planning:

- **Planning Model**: A conceptual model encompassing the interplay among a suitable planning type, relevant world context, and desired user features.
- **Technology Selection**: Highlights the importance of choosing appropriate planning technologies and the necessary support for such decision-making.
- **Data Provenance**: To ensure clarity and traceability of data sources and transformations throughout all lifecycle phases.

## Core Features

- **Adaptability**: Tailor the lifecycle to meet the specific needs of the respective project.
- **Scalability**: Expand or condense phases to match the project's development scale.
- **Transparency**: Based on clear, understandable processes.
- **Future-Proof**: Stay ahead with easily upgradable methodologies.
